## What is Override
Override is a platform for easily uploading your projects for SCP Secret Laboratory. This includes schematics, NW API plugin, EXILED plugins and maybe even server pre-builts.

## Current State of the Project
This project is currently in !! EARLY !! development. This project is currently only developed by me and Im a rookie when it comes to web development so dont expect the project to be super advanced. But this is hopefully going to be a big project so I will need
some help with it, more [here](#contributing)
